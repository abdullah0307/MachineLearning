I have data of health results from people in the organization. I want to you to make an analysis based on the data and give me the results you get from the analysis.

At the end, I expect that from result of the analysis, what can you recommend about the organization to help improve people's health. Also, how much does the waking event effect people's health?

Also, because it is hard to define healthy in this context and this set of data. You can assume that if the medical cost decreases = healthier and on the other hand, if the medical cost increase = not healthy.

1.I want you to do the analysis in Python.

2.These two are a must for models:

-logistic regression

-decision tree



and other models that seem good for the analysis. 

3.

These are the explanation for data

cost1-cost5 are how much did people pay for their medical cost from year1 to year5

Q and A is the answer collected from the questionnaire

Question is the list of questions being asked in the questionnaire.

test1-test5 are the result of health examination from year1 to year5

walking event collects a data of people join the event in each year.

special guidance will give you a guideline for those who tend to have a health issue and might result in paying for more medical cost
