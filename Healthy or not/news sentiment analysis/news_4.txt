Elon Musk's Tesla may be ready for a second innings in cryptocurrency payments
The electric car company owned by billionaire Elon Musk, Tesla, is mulling over possibly accepting cryptocurrency as payment again.
It had temporarily opened the doors to Bitcoin early in the year, before taking a u-turn over energy consumption concerns.
Electric car maker Tesla and its founder, Elon Musk, don't seem to have given up on crypto payments just yet. In its third-quarter earnings release today, the company hinted that it could start transacting in cryptocurrencies for its products and services in the future.
Tesla also said that in the nine months ended September 30, the company has bought an aggregate of $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin. "In addition, during the three months ended March 31, 2021, we accepted bitcoin as a payment for sales of certain of our products in specified regions, subject to applicable laws, and suspended this practice in May 2021," it added.
