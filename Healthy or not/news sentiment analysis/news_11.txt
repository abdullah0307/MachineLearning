Elon Musk's "Fanboy" Bet Nearly Everything On Tesla - And Made Billions
In March 2020, when equity markets tumbled and margin calls loomed, billionaire Leo Koguan was forced to sell much of his stock portfolio, including the vast majority of 12 million Tesla shares he then owned. Amid the early pandemic chaos, Koguan decided to act: he says he sold the rest of his stock holdings (including shares of Baidu, Nvidia, China Mobile and Nio) and used the proceeds to buy long-term call options on Tesla - in effect, betting the house.
It was a risky move but it paid off: Tesla shares have skyrocketed more than 1,440% since March 1. Koguan says he's plowed trading profits back into Tesla, and that today 100% of his stock portfolio consists of Tesla shares and call options. According to bank documents shared with Forbes, Koguan owns 6.3 million shares of Tesla and over 1.8 million in-the-money Tesla call options, as of Sep. 24.
"It's for [the] long term - you never bet short term on Tesla," Koguan says of his investment thesis. "And I believe in the green technology."
Koguan very publicly insists, on Twitter and LinkedIn, that he's the third largest individual Tesla shareholder. The company did not respond to requests for comment, though a company spokesman, Martin Viecha, appears to back Koguan's claim in a September tweet. As a non-company director who owns less than 5% holdings of outstanding Tesla stock, Koguan does not appear on any of Teslaâ€™s Securities and Exchange Commission filings. 
Given those Tesla shares and his stake in privately held IT company SHI International, Forbes estimates Koguan's fortune to be $8.6 billion; that number reflects a 20% discount to the Tesla holdings to take into account an undisclosed number of shares he holds in a margin account.
