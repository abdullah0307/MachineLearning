Elon Musk brings Shiba Inu back to Earth - Dogecoin is the only meme token he's betting on
Tech billionaire Elon Musk's tweets about his pet dog Floki may have been the driving force behind meme coin Shiba Inu's rally in the past. But, this time around the script flipped on itself when Musk revealed he doesn't actually own any SHIB tokens.
The Shiba Inu cryptocurrency was on its way 'to the Moon'on October 24. It rose by 50% to become the 11th biggest cryptocurrency in the market. However, one of the Shiba Inu Twitter accounts made the mistake of asking Musk how many SHIB tokens are in his kitty. The answer to which was a clear and definitive, "None."
Shiba Inu has slipped to becoming the 13th largest cryptocurrency by market cap since then. At 12:30 pm Indian Standard Time (IST) on October 25, the meme coin is down by 1.83 percent.
The recent dip may have halted its most recent rally, but the cryptocurrency has been on the rise since October 15.
And, for Musk, if there's a meme coin to bet on, it's Dogecoin. According to him, Dogecoin doesn't need to be another 'smart contract' token in the crypto space minting NFTs. Instead, Dogecoin should be working towards becoming a medium of exchange - fast, scalable and inexpensive.
