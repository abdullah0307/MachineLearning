SpaceX could make Elon Musk world's first trillionaire, says Morgan Stanley
Most of world's richest person's fortune so far has come from electric car company Tesla
Elon Musk, the world's richest person, with an estimated $241bn fortune, could become the first trillionaire, an investment bank has predicted.
Analysts at Morgan Stanley forecast that Musk, who has made most of his wealth from the electric car company Tesla, could make much more money from his fledgling space exploration business SpaceX.
The analyst Adam Jonas said the company, founded in 2002, was "challenging any preconceived notion of what was possible and the timeframe possible, in terms of rockets, launch vehicles and supporting infrastructure".
He added: "More than one client has told us if Elon Musk were to become the first trillionaire ... it won't be because of Tesla. Others have said SpaceX may eventually be the most highly valued company in the world â€“ in any industry."
Jonas said SpaceX's Starship reusable rockets that could take people and cargo to the moon and Mars had the potential to transform investor expectations around the space industry.
