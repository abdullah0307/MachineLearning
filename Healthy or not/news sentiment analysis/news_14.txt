App outage locks hundreds of Tesla drivers out of cars
Dozen of motorists report error as company's CEO, Elon Musk, apologises on Twitter
Hundreds of Tesla drivers were locked out of their cars at the start of the weekend after the manufacturer's mobile app suffered an outage - and dozens voiced their complaints on social media.
Elon Musk, Tesla's chief executive, said on Friday that the company's mobile application was coming back online after the app server outage. Musk was responding to a Tesla owner's tweet, who said that he was experiencing a "500 server error" to connect his Model 3 through the iOS app in Seoul, South Korea.
"Should be coming back online now. Looks like we may have accidentally increased verbosity of network traffic," Musk said.
The outage was first reported by specialist electric vehicle website Electrek, which started receiving reports from Tesla owners in the US and Canada, then from Europe and Asia.
About 500 users reported they faced an error at about 4.40pm ET (9.40pm GMT), according to outage monitoring website Downdetector, which tracks outages by collating status reports from a series of sources, including user-submitted errors on its platform. There were just over 60 reports by about 9.20pm ET.
