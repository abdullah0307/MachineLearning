First, we upload a data set files.
Then we merge all files to create a new data frame.
Now we separate the data for training and testing through indexing.
After splitting data apply the count vectorizer to transform data from textual to numeric form so the model can understand the data.
Applying a Naive-Bayes Algrothim To Find the Predictions.
Part2
In part 2 we create a list of positive and negative word files by using their text file through for loop and storing the results in a list.
After this apply Frequency Distribution a function of count vectorizer which is used to count the number of each word.
Apply a proportion formula to find positive words for each article and negative words for each article and store the values in the list.
Import a CSV file through the panda's library in which the values of Return Of Equity(ROE) and Net Profit Margin(NPM) are stored.
Calculate a company's performance based on ROE and NMP.
Create a data frame with features and labels.
Separate a feature and labels in training and testing data through indexing.
Apply the first Logistic Regression Model to a data set to find the predictions.
We use an SK-learn function feature importance to find an important feature of Logistic Regression.
The second Model is the Random Forests Model which is also used to find the predictions.
We also use an Sk-learn Regression feature importance to find an important feature of Random Forests.
